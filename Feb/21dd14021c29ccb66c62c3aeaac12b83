News - Date: 06 February 2022 Written by: Bernard Chiguvare / Viewed: 1059 “Dreams can always be achieved if one does not lose focus,” says Dr Elelwani Ramulifho from Malonga village in Tshimbupfe, who managed to fulfil her own dreams by obtaining her PhD in biotechnology from Wits University at the age of 30. Ramulifho (31) is the youngest of eight children. Her devoted parents, who had always advocated education although they themselves had never had the opportunity to study, supported her right through her education. Thanks to them, she could complete her BSc degree in biotechnology with the University of Pretoria (UP) in 2013. She completed her postgraduate studies in BSc (Honours) in biotechnology at the same institution. From the study field she chose, Ramulifho clearly has her country at heart. “The reason I chose this field of study was because I wanted to contribute to the fight for food security by producing crop varieties that can withstand and thrive under severe unfavourable environmental conditions brought about by climate change,” she said. Her research looked at the way in which crops and pathogens interacted. According to her, this particular research could provide answers to climate-change challenges and food production in South Africa. Dr Ramulifho’s thesis focused on plant viruses, and she looked at crops that manage to survive even when infected with a virus. “For me, education is the liberation of the mind; the ability to think independently, critically and innovatively. South Africa needs bright and free minds that will not agree with the status quo but explore innovate ways that will improve and build a country,” she said.
