News - Date: 28 February 2022 Written by: Anton van Zyl / Viewed: 1543 The Musina mayor, Nkhanedzeni Godfrey Mawela (39), appeared in court on Monday morning (28th) on assault charges. His bail of R3 000 was extended and the case was postponed to 29 April. Mawela was arrested in the early morning hours on Saturday at Muswodi village, following a brawl at a local tavern. Preliminary reports indicate that a fight broke out late on Friday night following a drinking spree. A 25-year-old man, Carris Munzhelele, was allegedly injured. On Sunday morning the spokesperson for the police in Limpopo, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, confirmed that a 39-year-old man was arrested by the police in connection with the incident. Mojapelo said that the suspect handed himself over to the police shortly after the incident. He was scheduled to appear in the Mutale magistrate’s court on Monday, 28 February. It appears that the Musina mayor lodged an urgent bail application on Saturday. He was released after paying R3 000 and attended Monday morning’s court appearance in the company of his lawyer. (The original report stated that the mayor was arrested early on Sunday morning. This was corrected.) Nkhanedzeni Godfrey Mawela, mayor of Musina Municipality.
