News - Date: 10 July 2022 Written by:  / Viewed: 385 Takalani Mathoho and his father, Muvhulawa, from Tshitereke village near the Donald Fraser Hospital, have a very inspiring story to share about how turning undesirable situations around and into something good is possible if one only adopts a positive perspective. Three years ago, the father and son grew concerned about the escalating illegal dumping that was taking place next to their home, and the negative impact this practice had on their lives and their health, so they started cleaning the area up to make it decent-looking and liveable again. The illegal dumping decreased somewhat, but some people still threw their trash out near their house. Muvhulawa and Takalani sat down again and finally decided to put this fertile soil to good use by starting a vegetable garden. Using Muvhulawa’s tractor, they began clearing the trash and tilling and preparing the ground before finally planting their vegetables. Although the produce they harvested were initially meant for their own consumption, people started flocking to their house, requesting to buy their vegetables, and that was how everything started. The extra income from their vegetable garden comes in quite handy now as it contributes to the household and things they need. “We are saving some cash now as we no longer have to buy vegetables,” Takalani smiles. Muvhulawa too is very happy that he and his son were able to tackle the issue of the dumping next to their home and are now making some profit in the process. He urges other community members who have the same problem to come up with ways of eradicating illegal dumping next to their residences. “Everyone can play a role in getting rid of illegal dumping. It rests upon all of us to come up with ways to contribute to the cleanliness of our environment.”  Takalani Mathoho at the vegetable garden he and his father established at their home next to an illegal dumping site in Tshitereke village.
