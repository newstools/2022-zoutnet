News - Date: 23 June 2022 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 259 As part of the implementation of their local economic development (LED) strategy to promote rural economies through informal trading, the Thulamela Local Municipality (TLM) has built 32 modern market stalls for the hawkers operating in front of the gate of the Donald Fraser Hospital in Vhufuli village, just outside Thohoyandou. Thulamela Mayor Sarah Rammbuda officially opened the market stalls on Wednesday, 15 June, saying that they had heard the hawkers complain about losing business on rainy and windy days, and during the cold season, so they decided to change life for the better for them. Rammbuda said that the state-of the art stalls had also given the old Donald Fraser Hospital a good facelift. She made an appeal to the hospital’s management and hawkers to take good care of the new market stalls as they (municipality) will not be coming to fix damages caused to the infrastructure after the handover. The acting CEO of the Donald Fraser Hospital, Mr Sipho Khosa, said that the hawkers would now have a better place to conduct their business. He promised that the management of the hospital would guard the stalls and the new mini-taxi rank against vandalism. One of the vendors at the market stalls, Ms Elelwani Masindi, expressed her joy over the new stalls. “Selling our products here at the gate of the hospital enables us to put food on the table for our families. These modern new market stalls will also mean improvement in our businesses,” said Masindi.  Thulamela Mayor Sarah Rammbuda (middle) cuts the ribbon.
