News - Date: 27 January 2022 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 836 A 30-year-old man from Tshitereke village appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, 25 January, on two counts of rape, sexual assault, five counts of child abuse as well as one of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The accused (who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child) is alleged to have preyed on an 11-year-old boy and his mother. The offences are alleged to have taken place between 2020 and 2021, but were only reported on 21 November 2021, after the boy had told a relative. The child could not tell his mother as she was in a relationship with the accused. According to a state witness, the mother opened a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm against the accused in August of 2020. She was pregnant with his child at the time. However, she then reconciled with him, and the case was withdrawn. The witness further told the court that the accused was likely to interfere with witnesses and intimidate the victims not to testify against him, should he be released on bail. Prosecutor Petronella Mudau pointed out that the accused is an employee of the Department of Education and employed as an assistant teacher at a lower primary school where he works with minor children. Mudau argued that a likelihood existed that the accused could be a danger to other children too, and that granting him bail was therefore not in the best interest of justice. According to the spokesperson for the Limpopo Division of the National Prosecuting Authority, Ms Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, bail was denied as he failed to prove exceptional circumstances and because he might pose a danger. His case was postponed to Friday, 28 January, for the Director of Public Prosecution’s decision.  The man accused of raping his 11-year-old stepson. Photo: Silas Nduvheni.  Email:
