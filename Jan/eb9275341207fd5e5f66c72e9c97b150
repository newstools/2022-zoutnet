News - Date: 23 January 2022 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 1156 Florence Radzilani from Maniini village near Thohoyandou was on cloud nine after recently being admitted as advocate. She currently works as a labour-relations practitioner at the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) in Pretoria and can now appear in the lower and district courts in the country. Radzilani celebrated this proud moment in her life with her family, friends, and local court colleagues at her home in Maniini on 27 December last year. She told her guests that women should stop hiding in the kitchens, waiting for their husbands to bring food to the table. “Even if you are a married woman with responsibilities at home, I urge you to get educated. Government offers financial assistance to those who are serious about furthering their education,” Radzilani said. One of her friends who attended the party, a state prosecutor at the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court, Mashudu Nekhumbe, hailed Radzilani for her success, despite being a rural woman with responsibilities at home. “A huna mabiko a sina malamba (hard work pays off). We know that it was not easy for you to study and attend part-time classes at the university while taking care of your family. It only proves that it is possible for women to make it too, and so we need to celebrate this great achievement.” Nekhumbe wished Radzilani all the best in her profession as advocate.
